# ProjectLibraries

A collection of libraries developed during previous projects. Recently created to update and organize my code, this repository serves as a reusable codebase for various functionalities such as display handling, buzzer songs, and differential drive movement types.

## Overview

Welcome to the ProjectLibraries repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of libraries developed during my previous projects. It includes libraries written in various programming languages and serves different purposes, from handling display outputs to generating buzzer songs and implementing differential drive movements.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Consolidate all my past library work in one place
- Organize and structure libraries for easy access and reuse
- Provide a reusable codebase for common functionalities and project templates
- Serve as a reference for best practices and coding standards

## Contents

This repository contains:

- **Differential Drive Movement Libraries**: Algorithms and functions for implementing differential drive movements.
